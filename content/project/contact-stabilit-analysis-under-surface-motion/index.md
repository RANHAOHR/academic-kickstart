Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation treatment. During radiofrequency ablation, the catheter needs to maintain steady contact with the substrate tissue with appropriate contact force to create a transmural scar, in order to create a gap-free lesion. The disturbance caused by heart surface motions can lead to unpredictable lesion formation during ablation. As such, maintaining stable contact while being subjected to the beating heart motions is critical.  A stable catheter-tissue contact should maintain the contact force inside the friction cone during the cardiac motion, in order to reduce the possibility of sliding and positional errors. A safe catheter-tissue contact will keep the normal force within the desired force limits and will ensure the formation of a transmural lesion. 

In this project, we investigate the contact stability & safety of the MRI-actuated robotic catheter during cardiac motion. We first formulated the contact force actuation Jacobian that approximates the relationship between the change of the contact force and the change of the actuation of the robotic catheter. Several contact force control algorithms and schemes are proposed for achieving contact stability and safety under cardiac motions.

The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed contact force control schemes are evaluated in a simulation environment using prerecorded in vivo left ventricle heart motion data.
